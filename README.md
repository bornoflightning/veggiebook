## Description

While logged in, Growers can create a profile with their username/farm name, a quick description, and what items they have in stock. Buyers can browse local growers' profiles, view them and their stock, and when they are ready reachout via email to discuss the purchase of specific items. 

VeggieBook - your online farmers market! 


## Usage

To use the application a user must login or set up an account. Note: if you set up an account you must declare if you are a buyer or a grower. Growers are the only ones who have the ability to set up store fronts.

- If logged in as a grower, users can set up store fronts by providing descriptions of their store, their inventory, and prices. 

- If logged in as a grower or a buyer, users can browse other store fronts and search for specific stores based on zipcode.
